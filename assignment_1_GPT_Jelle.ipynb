    "# Assignment 1: Transformers & Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to master the **Transformer architecture**, which is the engine behind modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. We will implement a compact, decoder-only transformer from scratch, closely following the [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) project by Andrej Karpathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train this model on textual figure captions from the [Open-MELON dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MartiHan/Open-MELON-VL-2.5K), which contains descriptions of histopathology images (specifically melanocytic lesions). After training, your model will be able to generate **synthetic captions** when prompted with a short starting sequence. Note that at this point we do not associate these captions with image data. We will go into vision-language models that can jointly model both image and text data in the next assignment. For now, we focus on text, but, as you will see in Assignment 2, extending the Transformer architecture to model image data is a straightforward extension. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was specifically prepared for this course (work done by Martina Hanusova). While this dataset is certainly not as large as the massive corpora used to train ChatGPT and consists of open-access figures and captions rather than medical images and clinical reports, it offers two  advantages. First, the content is highly dense with relevant medical terminology, which makes the training process efficient. Second, because we are using public data from medical publications, we avoid the complex legal and ethical hurdles associated with handling private patient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the assumption that you have a solid understanding of fundamental machine learning and neural network concepts, such as linear regression, gradient descent, backpropagation, and loss functions; if you need a refresher, please review materials from the previous courses (e.g. 8BB020 Introduction to Machine Learning). You must prepare for this assignment by mastering the Transformer architecture, specifically understanding self-attention mechanisms in neural networks and the distinction between encoder models and the decoder-only architectures (like GPT) used for generative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the architecture, you must also familiarize yourself with the basics of Computational Pathology to understand the medical context of our dataset (we will be generating captions for H&E stained histopathology images).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of materials that you can use to learn the topic of Transformers and prepare for the flipped classrooms:\n",

It gives a very \"gentle\" and high-level introduction of the mechanics of how (large) language models work and are trained. This includes the concept of autoregressive modelling (predicting the next word in a sequence), (pre)-training of large language models from text datasets (the \"P\" in GPT stands for \"pretrained\") as well as reinforcement learning with human feedback. While in this course we will keep to training of (relatively small) language models, it is good to have the complete picture.  The entire 3Blue1Brown channel is a very high-quality source of educational content on a wide range of topics. In fact, the entire [Neural networks]() playlist is highly recommended, also as a refresher to more fundamental concepts such as backpropagation. | \n",
    "| Paper | 10 pg. | [Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | This is the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture to the world. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject. The paper is relatively short (10 pages without references), however it can be a bit \"dense\" for beginners. That is ok, as the most important thing to understand is the tokenization of text and the self-attention mechanism. Both of these concepts are also covered in the next two recommended videos so it is best that you iterate between watching the videos and reading the paper. Note that one thing that might be particularly confusing is that the neural network architecture in this paper has both an encoder and decoder part. This is because the application that is addressed here is natural language translation (machine translation). In this setup, the encoder part is used to encode the text in the original language and the decoder is used to translate this encoded text into the target language. In this course we will focus on decoder-only architectures, which are used for generative tasks such as text generation. | \n",

    "## Exercises: Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ *The answers to the theory exercises are NOT to be submitted as part of the assignment deliverables. They can, however, be used to check your understanding of the materials and to prepare for the flipped classroom. You CAN include your discussion about the exercises in the flipped classroom log.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.1 \n",
    "\n",
    "A GPT model is autoregressive, meaning it generates text strictly one token at a time. It predicts the first next token, appends it to the sequence, and uses that updated sequence to predict the second token. This is a serial process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, many other neural networks process their entire input in parallel (all at once) to maximize speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we modified the architecture to predict every token in a paragraph simultaneously (in parallel) rather than one by one, is the resulting text likely to be grammatically coherent? Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment (as you will see later), we define tokens to be individual characters (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c'). This keeps our vocabulary small and the implementation simple. In contrast, the standard practice for modern Large Language Models is to use sub-word tokenization, which groups frequent character patterns into single tokens to process text more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we take this concept one step further and define tokens to be entire sentences. What would be the consequence of this when generating text?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.3\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of a Transformer is self-attention, which allows a token to look at other tokens to gather context. In a Decoder-only model (like GPT), we apply a specific constraint called Causal Self-Attention (or \"Masked\" Self-Attention) during training. This forces every token to look only at itself and the tokens that came before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from Encoder models, which use Bidirectional Attention, allowing tokens to see the entire sentence (past and future) at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that during training, we feed the entire completed sentence into the model at once. Will this model still be useful for generating text? Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.4 \n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder-only models (like GPT) are mathematically optimized to maximize the probability of the text sequence. This means that if they were trained with medical report data, they strive to generate text that \"looks\" and \"sounds\" like a real medical report. They are not optimized to check for factual truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that your trained model generates a synthetic pathology caption that includes specific quantitative details: \"The sample shows a high mitotic rate of 8 figures per 10 HPF.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this specific type of error (a plausible-sounding number) significantly more dangerous to a clinician than if the model had just generated obvious gibberish (e.g., \"rate figures high 8 10\" )?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.5 \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to train a model that generates a pathology report based on medical imaging data, we would need a joint vision-language model. We will touch on this in the next assignment. For now, assume that we want to generate a report based on some medical test or observations that we can represent as text data and make them part of the starting sequence that we use to prompt further generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example of how such a model would operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Sequence (Provided by User): \"Clinical Indication: Patient has a rapidly growing, asymmetrical black lesion on the left shoulder. Rule out Melanoma. Gross Description: ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generated Continuation (Predicted by Model): \"...Specimen consists of a skin ellipse measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals a proliferation of atypical melanocytes arranged in nests at the dermo-epidermal junction. There is upward migration of cells (pagetoid spread). DIAGNOSIS: MALIGNANT MELANOMA.\"\n",

    "Would such a model be useful in clinical practice? Motivate your answer."

    "⚠️ *Everything below this line must be submitted as a deliverable for this assignment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ *Answering the exercises below will require you to implement new code and/or modify the code in cells above. You can add the code directly in the notebook or in separate Python files, depending on your preference. If you write code in separate files, please do not forget to also submit them. The exercises will also require re-running the training, sometimes multiple times. You can split the workload among the group members so things are done more efficiently.*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises: Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "When we created the text corpus, we used the <ENDC> separator to mark the end of a caption. Why is the <ENDC> separator needed? What would happen if you use a model trained without such separator in practice? In order to investigate this, train a model without the <ENDC> separator and compare the results with the model trained with the <ENDC> separator when generating captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the model and plot training loss and validation loss as a function of training iterations. Modify the following hyperparameters and observe the effect:\n",
    "- Learning rate\n",
    "- Batch size\n",
    "- Evaluation interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain why the observed changes occur. What patterns indicate underfitting? What patterns suggest overfitting or unstable training?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the number of tokens by converting all letters to either uppercase or lowercase. Implement this in the preprocessing function and retrain a model. Report your observations on the training and performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 2500 figure captions. After encoding and splitting out 10% of the tokens for validation, we are left with 874488 training tokens. Is this also the number of training samples used to train our NanoGPT model? If yes, explain why, if not try to estimate the actual number of training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation depends strongly on the sampling hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate captions using at least three different temperature values and two different top_k values. Include at least 10 generated examples per hyperparameter configuration in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each configuration, comment on the following characteristics of the generated samples:\n",
    "  - Fluency and structure\n",
    "  - Repetition or degeneration\n",
    "  - Factual plausibility (even if the content is synthetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify optimal configuration of parameters that balances coherence and diversity of the produced synthetic captions, and justify your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flipped Classroom Log\n",
    "\n",
    "ℹ️ *You have to fill this log for both flipped classroom sessions for this assignment. You only fill the log for your group, not together with the group that you interacted with.*\n",
