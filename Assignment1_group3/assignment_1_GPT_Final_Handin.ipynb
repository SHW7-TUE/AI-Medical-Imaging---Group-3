    "# Assignment 1: Transformers & Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment is to master the **Transformer architecture**, which is the engine behind modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek. We will implement a compact, decoder-only transformer from scratch, closely following the [NanoGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) project by Andrej Karpathy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train this model on textual figure captions from the [Open-MELON dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MartiHan/Open-MELON-VL-2.5K), which contains descriptions of histopathology images (specifically melanocytic lesions). After training, your model will be able to generate **synthetic captions** when prompted with a short starting sequence. Note that at this point we do not associate these captions with image data. We will go into vision-language models that can jointly model both image and text data in the next assignment. For now, we focus on text, but, as you will see in Assignment 2, extending the Transformer architecture to model image data is a straightforward extension. \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset was specifically prepared for this course (work done by Martina Hanusova). While this dataset is certainly not as large as the massive corpora used to train ChatGPT and consists of open-access figures and captions rather than medical images and clinical reports, it offers two  advantages. First, the content is highly dense with relevant medical terminology, which makes the training process efficient. Second, because we are using public data from medical publications, we avoid the complex legal and ethical hurdles associated with handling private patient data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the assumption that you have a solid understanding of fundamental machine learning and neural network concepts, such as linear regression, gradient descent, backpropagation, and loss functions; if you need a refresher, please review materials from the previous courses (e.g. 8BB020 Introduction to Machine Learning). You must prepare for this assignment by mastering the Transformer architecture, specifically understanding self-attention mechanisms in neural networks and the distinction between encoder models and the decoder-only architectures (like GPT) used for generative tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the architecture, you must also familiarize yourself with the basics of Computational Pathology to understand the medical context of our dataset (we will be generating captions for H&E stained histopathology images).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a list of materials that you can use to learn the topic of Transformers and prepare for the flipped classrooms:\n",

It gives a very \"gentle\" and high-level introduction of the mechanics of how (large) language models work and are trained. This includes the concept of autoregressive modelling (predicting the next word in a sequence), (pre)-training of large language models from text datasets (the \"P\" in GPT stands for \"pretrained\") as well as reinforcement learning with human feedback. While in this course we will keep to training of (relatively small) language models, it is good to have the complete picture.  The entire 3Blue1Brown channel is a very high-quality source of educational content on a wide range of topics. In fact, the entire [Neural networks]() playlist is highly recommended, also as a refresher to more fundamental concepts such as backpropagation. | \n",
    "| Paper | 10 pg. | [Attention Is All You Need (Vaswani et al.)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) | This is the paper that introduced the Transformer architecture to the world. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the subject. The paper is relatively short (10 pages without references), however it can be a bit \"dense\" for beginners. That is ok, as the most important thing to understand is the tokenization of text and the self-attention mechanism. Both of these concepts are also covered in the next two recommended videos so it is best that you iterate between watching the videos and reading the paper. Note that one thing that might be particularly confusing is that the neural network architecture in this paper has both an encoder and decoder part. This is because the application that is addressed here is natural language translation (machine translation). In this setup, the encoder part is used to encode the text in the original language and the decoder is used to translate this encoded text into the target language. In this course we will focus on decoder-only architectures, which are used for generative tasks such as text generation. | \n",

    "## Exercises: Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ *The answers to the theory exercises are NOT to be submitted as part of the assignment deliverables. They can, however, be used to check your understanding of the materials and to prepare for the flipped classroom. You CAN include your discussion about the exercises in the flipped classroom log.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.1 \n",
    "\n",
    "A GPT model is autoregressive, meaning it generates text strictly one token at a time. It predicts the first next token, appends it to the sequence, and uses that updated sequence to predict the second token. This is a serial process.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, many other neural networks process their entire input in parallel (all at once) to maximize speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we modified the architecture to predict every token in a paragraph simultaneously (in parallel) rather than one by one, is the resulting text likely to be grammatically coherent? Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.2\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment (as you will see later), we define tokens to be individual characters (e.g., 'a', 'b', 'c'). This keeps our vocabulary small and the implementation simple. In contrast, the standard practice for modern Large Language Models is to use sub-word tokenization, which groups frequent character patterns into single tokens to process text more efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that we take this concept one step further and define tokens to be entire sentences. What would be the consequence of this when generating text?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.3\n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept of a Transformer is self-attention, which allows a token to look at other tokens to gather context. In a Decoder-only model (like GPT), we apply a specific constraint called Causal Self-Attention (or \"Masked\" Self-Attention) during training. This forces every token to look only at itself and the tokens that came before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is different from Encoder models, which use Bidirectional Attention, allowing tokens to see the entire sentence (past and future) at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that during training, we feed the entire completed sentence into the model at once. Will this model still be useful for generating text? Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.4 \n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder-only models (like GPT) are mathematically optimized to maximize the probability of the text sequence. This means that if they were trained with medical report data, they strive to generate text that \"looks\" and \"sounds\" like a real medical report. They are not optimized to check for factual truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that your trained model generates a synthetic pathology caption that includes specific quantitative details: \"The sample shows a high mitotic rate of 8 figures per 10 HPF.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this specific type of error (a plausible-sounding number) significantly more dangerous to a clinician than if the model had just generated obvious gibberish (e.g., \"rate figures high 8 10\" )?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise T.5 \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to train a model that generates a pathology report based on medical imaging data, we would need a joint vision-language model. We will touch on this in the next assignment. For now, assume that we want to generate a report based on some medical test or observations that we can represent as text data and make them part of the starting sequence that we use to prompt further generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following example of how such a model would operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Sequence (Provided by User): \"Clinical Indication: Patient has a rapidly growing, asymmetrical black lesion on the left shoulder. Rule out Melanoma. Gross Description: ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Generated Continuation (Predicted by Model): \"...Specimen consists of a skin ellipse measuring 2.0 x 1.5 cm. Microscopic examination reveals a proliferation of atypical melanocytes arranged in nests at the dermo-epidermal junction. There is upward migration of cells (pagetoid spread). DIAGNOSIS: MALIGNANT MELANOMA.\"\n",

    "Would such a model be useful in clinical practice? Motivate your answer."

    "- `vocab_size` - number of unique tokens the model can process. In this assignment, tokens are individual characters, so the vocabulary size equals the number of distinct characters in the training corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `block_size` - the context window length, i.e. the maximum number of tokens the model can see at once. During training and generation, the model predicts the next token using only the previous block_size tokens. A larger block size allows the model to capture longer-range dependencies but increases memory and computation requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n_layer` - number of stacked transformer decoder blocks. More layers increase model depth and expressiveness but also training time and risk of overfitting.\n",

    "- `n_embd` - dimensionality of token embeddings and hidden representations. Larger embeddings allow richer representations but increase memory usage and compute cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `eval_interval` - number of training iterations between evaluations on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `eval_iters` - number of mini-batches used to estimate training and validation loss during evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `lr (learning rate)` - step size used by the optimizer when updating model parameters. This is one of the most sensitive hyperparameters for training stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `weight_decay` - regularization term that penalizes large weights and helps reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `device` - specifies whether training runs on CPU or GPU. Smaller model and batch sizes are used automatically when no GPU is available.\n"

Multiple attention heads are used so that the model can focus on different aspects of the context in parallel. The MLP applies a non-linear transformation independently at each position, complementing the attention mechanism. Layer normalization and residual connections are used throughout to stabilize training and preserve information flow.\n"

    "## Exercises: Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "When we created the text corpus, we used the <ENDC> separator to mark the end of a caption. Why is the <ENDC> separator needed? What would happen if you use a model trained without such separator in practice? In order to investigate this, train a model without the <ENDC> separator and compare the results with the model trained with the <ENDC> separator when generating captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1 — Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<ENDC>` separator is needed because all captions are concatenated into one long character stream. Without an explicit boundary token, the model cannot know where one caption ends and the next begins. Adding `\\n<ENDC>\\n` gives a consistent end-of-caption signal, so the model can learn both (1) when to stop a caption and (2) how a new caption typically starts. In practice, a model trained **with `<ENDC>`** produces more controllable and structured output: it often generates `<ENDC>` and then starts a new caption-like sentence, clearly separating captions. A model trained **without `<ENDC>`** tends to produce “run-on” generations where multiple caption fragments blend together without a clear stopping point, and it shows more repetition/degeneration because it never learned a clean boundary between captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the model and plot training loss and validation loss as a function of training iterations. Modify the following hyperparameters and observe the effect:\n",
    "- Learning rate\n",
    "- Batch size\n",
    "- Evaluation interval\n",
    "Explain why the observed changes occur. What patterns indicate underfitting? What patterns suggest overfitting or unstable training?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2 — Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained the NanoGPT model and plotted training and validation loss versus training iterations while varying learning rate, batch size, and evaluation interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of learning rate\n",
    "The learning rate controls the step size of parameter updates.\n",
    "- With a **lower learning rate (0.0003)**, both training and validation loss decrease more slowly and remain higher for longer, indicating slower convergence.\n",
    "- With a **medium learning rate (0.001)**, loss decreases fastest in a stable way and achieves the lowest validation loss in the shown runs, suggesting the best trade-off between speed and stability.\n",
    "- With a **higher learning rate (0.003)**, the model still learns but the curves are less optimal (validation loss stays slightly higher / convergence is less smooth), consistent with overshooting or less stable optimization at larger steps.\n",
    "Training time per iteration is largely unaffected by learning rate, but convergence speed (in number of iterations) can differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of batch size\n",
    "Batch size affects gradient noise and smoothness of learning.\n",
    "- With a **small batch size (8)**, the validation loss remains noticeably higher and improves more slowly. This is consistent with noisier gradient estimates leading to less efficient learning. Each iteration is computationally cheaper, but more iterations may be required for convergence.\n",
    "- **Larger batch sizes (32 and 64)** produce smoother, more stable loss curves and lower final losses. In the shown plot, batch size 64 performs slightly best overall, with almost identical performance to 32. However, larger batches increase memory usage and computation time per iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect of evaluation interval\n",
    "The evaluation interval changes how often loss is measured, not how training updates are computed.\n",
    "- A **smaller eval_interval (50)** gives a more detailed curve (more points), but adds overhead because evaluation is run more frequently, slightly increasing total training time.\n",
    "- A **larger eval_interval (500)** gives fewer measurement points (a coarser curve), which can hide short-term fluctuations. Training runs slightly faster because validation is computed less often.\n",
    "Any small differences between curves mainly reflect logging frequency and stochasticity rather than a systematic improvement from eval_interval itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Underfitting, overfitting, unstable training\n",
    "- **Underfitting:** both training and validation loss remain high and close together, improving slowly or plateauing early (model capacity/optimization not sufficient to fit even the training data well).\n",
    "- **Overfitting:** training loss keeps decreasing while validation loss stops improving or increases, creating a growing gap between train and val.\n",
    "- **Unstable training:** large oscillations or spikes in loss, divergence, or failure to trend downward consistently (often caused by too high learning rate or overly noisy updates).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3 — Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this experiment, we converted the entire corpus to lowercase before building the tokenizer and retraining the model. Converting to lowercase reduces the number of unique tokens because uppercase and lowercase versions of the same letter are merged. As a result, the vocabulary size decreased from 109 to 83 characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Baseline model:\n",
    "train_loss = 1.15, validation_loss = 1.18  \n",
    "Lowercase model:\n",
    "train_loss = 1.06, validation_loss = 1.13  \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the vocabulary is smaller, the prediction task becomes slightly simpler: the model has fewer possible next characters to choose from. This leads to lower training and validation loss and slightly more efficient learning. However, stylistic quality decreases. Removing uppercase letters eliminates capitalization at sentence starts and in abbreviations (e.g., H&E), making the generated captions less natural and less realistic. Overall, case normalization slightly improves loss values but removes stylistic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 4\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 2500 figure captions. After encoding and splitting out 10% of the tokens for validation, we are left with 874488 training tokens. Is this also the number of training samples used to train our NanoGPT model? If yes, explain why, if not try to estimate the actual number of training samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 4 — Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "No, 874,488 is not the number of training samples. It is the number of training tokens. In NanoGPT, a training sample is not a single token but a sequence of length `block_size`. The number of possible sliding windows that can be extracted from the token sequence is approximately `training_tokens − block_size − 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `block_size = 64` (CPU), this gives 874,488 − 64 − 1 = 874,423 possible samples.  \n",
    "If `block_size = 256` (GPU), this gives 874,488 − 256 − 1 = 874,231 possible samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The extra −1 is required because each input sequence needs one additional token as the prediction target (the next character).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model does not iterate over all possible windows. During training, start indices are sampled randomly each iteration, so the actual number of samples seen depends on `max_iters × batch_size`, not on the total number of possible windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Text generation depends strongly on the sampling hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate captions using at least three different temperature values and two different top_k values. Include at least 10 generated examples per hyperparameter configuration in your report.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each configuration, comment on the following characteristics of the generated samples:\n",
    "  - Fluency and structure\n",
    "  - Repetition or degeneration\n",
    "  - Factual plausibility (even if the content is synthetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify optimal configuration of parameters that balances coherence and diversity of the produced synthetic captions, and justify your choice.\n",

    "## Exercise 5 — Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "We generated captions using three temperature values (0.3, 0.7, 1.5) and two top_k values (10, 60), with 10 samples per configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 0.3, top_k = 10\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** Very fluent and strongly follows the dataset style (H&E stain + magnification). Captions are mostly well-formed.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Noticeable repetition of common phrases (e.g., repeated “prominent nucleoli”) and frequent similar sentence templates.\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Generally plausible histopathology wording, but often repetitive and slightly generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 0.3, top_k = 60\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** Still fluent and structured, but slightly more varied wording than top_k=10.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Repetition is reduced compared to top_k=10, though some standard phrases remain common.\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Mostly plausible; broader vocabulary produces more variation while staying within domain language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 0.7, top_k = 10\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** Mostly coherent, but more occasional awkward phrasing and abrupt transitions than temperature=0.3.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Less repetitive than temperature=0.3, but still tends to reuse certain patterns.\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Often plausible, but sometimes mixes concepts or produces slightly inconsistent descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 0.7, top_k = 60\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** More diverse outputs and still often caption-like, but with more grammatical noise and occasional loss of structure.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Lower repetition overall, but a higher chance of drifting or producing less consistent text.\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Mixed; many captions remain plausible, but some become less precise or less internally consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 1.5, top_k = 10\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** Clear degradation in fluency: spelling errors, malformed words, and reduced caption structure appear frequently.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Degeneration increases (nonsense fragments and unstable text).\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Lower; terms are often corrupted and captions become less meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### temperature = 1.5, top_k = 60\n",
    "- **Fluency and structure:** Worst overall. Many samples become highly incoherent with strong noise and broken formatting.\n",
    "- **Repetition/degeneration:** Strong degeneration; random characters/word fragments appear often.\n",
    "- **Factual plausibility:** Very low; outputs frequently stop resembling realistic captions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimal configuration\n",
    "The best balance between coherence and diversity in my runs was **temperature = 0.3, top_k = 60**.  \n",
    "This setting preserved fluent caption structure and plausible histopathology language, while providing more variety than top_k=10. Higher temperature settings increased diversity but noticeably reduced fluency and factual plausibility due to instability and degeneration.\n",
